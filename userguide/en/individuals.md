# Poracle for Individuals
Aside from using the bot in groups, it is possible to receive personalized notifications from the bot in a private chat. 
To use poracle, you first need to be registered.  The registration mechanism is different for each installation of
Poracle - but you may be granted access by a specific role or group membership - or you may need to call for 
Poracle by sending a command such as **`/poracle`** into a specific registration channel.

Once you have entered the */poracle*-command, you will receive a green check mark emoji in response. Afterwards, the user 
has to start the bot privately. Configuration of tracking in public groups or channels is only available to
administrators.

Your administrator may also have set up PoracleWeb, a web based configuration tool which allows you to add tracking
in a visual way.
