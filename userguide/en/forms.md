# Special Form_Names
Some Pokémon in the game have multiple forms. Those forms all have the same Pokémon name, but can be filtered separately. E.g. **`/track Exeggutor`** sends notifications for both forms of Exeggutor, Alola and normal (Kanto). However, you can also track only the normal form using **`/track Exeggutor formnormal`**.
