# Filtering Options

## Basics

### Simple commands

When you are talking to Poracle there are a few basic commands you should remember

Command | Description
--- | ---
**!help** | Replies with some help text
**!tracked** | Display a summary of everything you are currently tracking
**!stop** | Stop sending me messages - if you have tracked too much this can be a good way to stop Poracle spamming you!
**!start** | Start sending messages again

Poracle will temporarily stop sending you notifications if you receive too many over a short period of time.  If you
do this repeatedly then it will stop sending you any notifications at all. Usually you can fix your tracking and
issue a *!start* command to resume, but you may be asked to contact your site administrator.

### Notification area

You will only receive notifications for things that happen within the areas you have opted in, _or_ within a certain 
distance from a specific location you set.

When you first start to use poracle, it is sensible to use the pre-defined areas

### Tracking by areas

**`!area list`** will show you a list of all the areas that are available to you.  You can add tracking in these
areas using **`!area add`** and remove them with **`area remove`**.  You can see the areas, and every other detail
about your tracking using `!tracked`

The area command helpfully can show you the extent of an area using the `!area show` command.

### Setting your location

You can set your home location and ask for notifications only within a certain distance of that. You do this by specifying !location -

eg `!location 10 New Dover Road, London SW3 4SX`

or find the latitude and longitude of your address in google maps and set it directly

eg `!location 51.279,1.080`

Once you have specified your location you will then be able to a distance marker to any notifications by using the `d` flag - for example `!egg level5 d500` - to see things within 500m of your house

### Distance guide

How far/fast can you walk? Here is a guide from the internet (so it must be true!)

Metres | Fast | Moderate | Easy Walk
---|---|---|---
1000   |   7   |    10    |     13
2000   |   14  |    20    |     25
3000   |   21  |    30    |     38
4000   |   28  |    40    |     50
5000   |   35  |    50    |     63

**`/tracked`**  
shows the current filtering settings, followed by specifications on the location, the selected areas and all filters referring to anything from [Pokémon](#pokémon) to [Rocket/Invasion](#rocketinvasion).

## Things you can be notified about!

## Pokémon

There are a lot of options for filtering your alerts to get the pokemon you want.  The [Track](track.md) page contains all the detail, this just describes the
basics.

**`/track pikachu d1000 iv20`**

**`/track`**  
All commands to receive Pokémon notifications start with "!track". Using "!untrack [...]", you can remove the respective commands again. 

**`pikachu`**  
This part of the command indicates which Pokémon the command refers to. It is possible to name one or more Pokémon using their Pokédex numbers or name (multiple languages are supported if your
Poracle is configured for this), separated by space. You can track all Pokémon using "everything".
You can track all Pokemon of a particular type - eg `!track dark` and filter pokemon using a generation - eg `!track everything gen1` or `!track dragon gen3`

**`d1000`**  
If you do not specify a *'d' (distance) filter, then the areas you have selected using the !area command will be used to filter these alerts.
If you do specify a distance, then you will be notified if a pokemon falls within the area around your location.

You can see what a particular distance radius looks like for you by doing eg `!area show d1000`

**`iv20`**  
"ivX" indicates the minimum IVs the Pokémon must have to warrant a notification. If you do not set an "ivX", then no minimum will be used.  
There are other options including "maxivX" indicates the maximum IVs a Pokémon may have to warrant a notification. An iv of -1 is used
when the IV is not known, so in this case specifying a minimum iv of 0 may be advisable too.

Examples:  
**`!track pikachu iv100`** - sends notifications for all Pikachu with 100 IV. 
**`!track pikachu iv0 maxiv0`** - sends notifications for all Pikachu with 0 IV.  
**`!track pikachu miniv50 maxiv60`** - sends notifications for all Pikachu with IVs between 50% and 60%.

**Note:** IV specifications will be rounded to whole numbers. A Pokémon classified as IV98 actually has 44 of 45 possible IV points (15atk,15def,15sta), which are 97.77% mathematically.  
Since, IV97.77 should not be included in the IV range 98 you would be best filtering for IV97 to capture all IV98 Pokemon.

You can specify more filters (eg levels, atk, def, sta) - see [Track](track.md) for more details.

Additionally to the Pokémon names, Poracle also knows various names for specific forms, e.g. to look only for Alola-Pokémon. You can find an explicit list in the section [Pokémon Forms](#special-form_names).

You can create several entries for a single Pokémon. 
For example, you could use two commands to receive notifications for Pokémon with maximum IV0 and Pokémon with minimum IV100. 

Important: to check if a !track command works as intended, use the command **`!tracked`** whenever you need to. This way, the bot will show you all filter settings it is currently using. 

## Quests
All quest commands start with **`/!quest`** and can be removed again using **`!quest remove`**. Quest commands work within areas or distances as described above.

### Pokémon
**`/quest Pikachu`** - sends notifications for all quests with Pikachu as a reward. 

### Items  
**`/quest everything`** - sends notifications for all quests.
**`/quest all_items`** - sends notifications for all item reward quests.
**`/quest all_pokemon`** - sends notifications for all pokemon reward quests.
**`/quest rare_candy`** - sends notifications for all quests with rare candy as a reward.

### Stardust
**`!quest stardust`** - all quests with stardust as a reward.
**`!quest stardust500`** - all quests with at least 500 stardust as a reward. 

### Mega Candy
** `!quest energy`** - all quests with mega energy as a reward
** `!quest energybulbasaur` ** - all quests with bulbasaur mega energy

## Raids
There are two different kinds of Raid notifications. You can receive notifications when Raid Eggs first appear or when a certain Raid Boss hatches. 
For Eggs, your command starts with *!egg*, while the command for the Raid Boss starts with *!raid*.
Consequently, you have to use *!raid*-commands to receive notifications for specific Pokémon.

**`!raid Snorlax`** - sends notifications for all Snorlax Raids. 

Additionally, you can set the following filters for *!raid*-commands and *!egg*-commands (most of the filters can be combined freely):

**`!raid(!egg) level5`** - sends notifications for all Tier 5 Raids or Eggs (cannot be combined with a filter for specific Pokémon!) Note level 6 is for mega raids!

**`!raid(!egg) d1000`** - Raids can be filtered by location.

**`!raid(!egg) ex`** - sends notifications only for Raids at Gyms that are currently labeled as EX Raid Gyms.

**`!raid(!egg) instinct/valor/mystic/harmony`** - sends notifications only for Raids at Gyms currently controlled by the selected team.

**`!raid(!egg) everything`** - sends notifications for all Raids/Eggs.

**`!egg remove`** or **`!raid remove`** removes all filters for Raids and Eggs. It can also refer to single Raid Tiers and Pokémon, e.g **`!raid remove Snorlax`**.

## Rocket/Invasion
Currently, scanning Rocket-invaded PokéStops only happens passively. This means that the PokéStops are not actively approached, just detected by the radar. At any point where a scanner is doing a job of any kind, e.g. scanning a Pokémon, it collects information about invaded Stops in the surrounding area.

Included is information on the location of the grunt, their quote, and their gender. There is a specific set of Pokémon assigned to every combination of quote and gender. This set consists of different Pokémon which can be encountered as invasion reward at different odds.

Since the workers never actively engage in a Rocket battle, they do not know exactly which Pokémon will be the reward. Consequently, you cannot filter for specific Pokémon in Poracle, but only for type and gender.

All invasion-commands start with */invasion*. 
You can remove all filtering settings for invasions using **`/invasion remove everything`**. 

**`!invasion everything`** - sends notifications for all invaded Stops. 

*!invasion*-commands can be specified by both areas and distances (d). 

Additionally, you can filter by all 16 available Pokémon types and gender.
