# Poracle

Poracle is the interface we use between the scanner systems and the users. Poracle decides which incoming data will be interesting for single users and forwards the data to them.

This means every user can feed Poracle manually with filtering settings to generate personalized output. There are two different ways to access our data. Poracle can be set up in group chats, but users can also use it in their own private chat.
