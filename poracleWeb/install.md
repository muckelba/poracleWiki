### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bbdoc/PoracleWeb.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `config_example.php` to `config.php` and adapt to your needs
4. Have a Web Server pointing to your install directory (This tool doesn't include any standalone WebServer)

5. You will need to configure your Discord Bot settings in config.php. If you use PMSF, you can reuse the same parameters for `discordBotClientId` and `discordBotClientSecret` or find them on the [Discord application Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). `redirect_url` should point to your PoracleWeb base directory and should be configured as a Redirects in your Discord bot.

For those parameters go to :
- [Discord application Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Select your Bot (or create a new one).
- Go to OAuth2 and add your `https://yourdomain.com/discord_auth.php` (`https://yourdomain.com`) being your `redirect_url`
- Client ID can be found under "General Information"
- Client Secret can be found under "General Information" by clicking the "Click to reveal" link.



### Configurating API in Poracle

```json
  "server": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",        // host name to listen on 127.0.0.1 only localhost; 0.0.0.0 would be in all network interfaces
      "port": "3030",             // port
    // ipWhitelist, ipBlacklist - array of whitelisted or blacklisted addresses
      "ipWhitelist": [],
      "ipBlacklist": [],
      "apiSecret": ""             // apiSecret to use for access to Poracle API -- blank API disabled
  },
```

### Testing the API

To test the API: 
```bash
curl -i -H "X-Poracle-Secret: whatever" http://localhost:4201/api/config/poracleWeb
```

Replace the secret, address and port with your own
